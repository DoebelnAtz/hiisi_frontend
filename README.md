<h2>NORM RULES FOR HIVEMIND:</h2>

React component files and function have to be Capitalized and follow camelCase, other .js files should just be camelCase

.css files should be lowercase

Don't put all .js files in the same directory, try to split 
them up into subdirectories by function

Enclose function arguments in parenthesis even  if it only takes
one arguments, return statements should always be
multiline.

example:

    const App = ->(props)<- => {
      ->return(
            <div>App</div>
        );<-
    }
