<h2>Hiisi</h2>

<a href="https://hiisi.app">Site</a>

<p>
    Hiisi is a website for Hive students where they can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Share and find resources for learning.</li>
    <li>Manage and share their projects</li>
    <li>Engage in general discussion in a forum exclusive for Hive students</li>
</ul>


<p>
    I created this site because i noticed there were a lot of Hive students with personal lists of good
    resources for learning programming. But there was no convenient way to effectively share theese resources with their peers
</p>

<p>
    I also wanted to create a place where students could list and manage the projects they are currently working on.
